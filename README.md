# Discord-bot
A Discord bot based on my cat. The bot is meant to be fun, interactive, informative, and a parody version of my cat.

I will not provide all the files required for the bot to function since some of the files contains sensitive information about the bot.

The bot is far from being done and I am not able to constantly work on it, so I do not think I will be done implementing everything soon.
However, I am satisfied with many of the features I have added so far, my friends seems to enjoy them as well.
